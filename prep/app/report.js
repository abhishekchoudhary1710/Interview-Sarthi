Evaluate each answer against the question actually asked and the candidate's experience: an introduction needs a clear relevant background, a project walkthrough needs purpose and personal contribution, a technical answer needs sound reasoning, and a behavioural answer needs actions and outcomes. Reward specific evidence where relevant, but do not require numbers or technical depth in an introduction.
